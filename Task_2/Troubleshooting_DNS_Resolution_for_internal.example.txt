Task 2: Verify DNS Resolution
To diagnose why internal.example.com is unreachable with “host not found” errors, we first verify DNS resolution. The goal is to compare how the system’s configured DNS server (from /etc/resolv.conf) resolves the hostname versus a public DNS server like 8.8.8.8.
Steps to Verify DNS Resolution

Check the Current DNS ConfigurationView the DNS servers configured in /etc/resolv.conf to understand which servers the system is querying.
cat /etc/resolv.conf

Expected Output:  
nameserver 192.168.1.1
nameserver 192.168.1.2

This shows the system is using internal DNS servers (e.g., 192.168.1.1 and 192.168.1.2).Screenshot Note: Capture the output of cat /etc/resolv.conf to document the configured DNS servers.

Test DNS Resolution Using System DNSUse dig or nslookup to query internal.example.com using the system’s default DNS servers.
dig internal.example.com

Expected Output (if resolution fails):  
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;internal.example.com.          IN      A

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
example.com.            3600    IN      SOA     ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                                        2025042701 ; serial
                                        7200       ; refresh
                                        3600       ; retry
                                        1209600    ; expire
                                        3600       ; minimum
                                        )
;; Query time: 50 msec
;; SERVER: 192.168.1.1#53(192.168.1.1)

If no ANSWER SECTION appears, the DNS server cannot resolve internal.example.com.Screenshot Note: Capture the dig output to show whether an IP address was returned or if the query failed.

Test DNS Resolution Using Google’s DNS (8.8.8.8)Explicitly query 8.8.8.8 to see if the public DNS resolves the hostname differently.
dig @8.8.8.8 internal.example.com

Expected Output (likely fails for internal hostname):  
;; QUESTION SECTION:
;internal.example.com.          IN      A

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
example.com.            3600    IN      SOA     ns1.example.com. hostmaster.example.com. (
                                        2025042701 ; serial
                                        7200       ; refresh
                                        3600       ; retry
                                        1209600    ; expire
                                        3600       ; minimum
                                        )
;; Query time: 30 msec
;; SERVER: 8.8.8.8#53(8.8.8.8)

Since internal.example.com is likely an internal hostname, 8.8.8.8 probably won’t resolve it. This confirms the hostname is meant for internal DNS only.Screenshot Note: Capture this dig output to compare with the system DNS result.

Alternative: Use nslookup for SimplicityIf dig is unavailable, use nslookup to perform similar checks.
nslookup internal.example.com
nslookup internal.example.com 8.8.8.8

Expected Output (if resolution fails):  
Server:         192.168.1.1
Address:        192.168.1.1#53

** server can't find internal.example.com: NXDOMAIN

Screenshot Note: Capture nslookup outputs for both queries.


Analysis

If the system’s DNS (192.168.1.1) fails to resolve internal.example.com but is expected to, the internal DNS server may be misconfigured or down.
If 8.8.8.8 fails (as expected for an internal hostname), this is normal behavior.
If both fail and you know internal.example.com should resolve internally, the issue lies with the internal DNS server or client configuration.

Next Steps

If DNS resolution fails, we’ll explore potential DNS-related causes in Task 3.
If resolution succeeds (e.g., returns 192.168.1.100), proceed to Task 2 to check service reachability.
